					<h1>Frozen yogurt</h1>
					<p>Frozen yogurt (also spelled frozen yoghurt; also known as frogurt or by the tradename Froyo /ˈfroʊjoʊ/) is a frozen dessert made with yogurt and sometimes other dairy products including non-dairy products. It is usually more tart than ice cream, as well as lower in fat (due to the use of milk instead of cream). It is different from ice milk (more recently termed low-fat or light ice cream) and conventional soft serve. Unlike yogurt,[1] frozen yogurt is not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)[2][3] but is regulated by some U.S. states.[4][5] Frozen yogurt may or may not contain live and active bacteria cultures.</p>

					<h1>The History of Yogurt</h1>
					<p>People have been eating plain yogurt for over four millennia, particularly in the Middle East and India. Yogurt was brought to the U.S. in the early 1900s and steadily increased in popularity as a health food item over the next several decades. In the 1930s Dannon began selling prepackaged yogurt for the first time in the U.S. By the 1970s, with the popularity of ice cream surging, freezing and production technology was transferred to the production of frozen yogurt. Many consumers, however, complained about the yogurt taste.[6]

Capitalizing on consumer demand for a sweet product that tasted like ice cream but was healthier, TCBY opened its first store in 1981. Unlike previous pre-packaged versions introduced earlier, TCBY's yogurt was soft-serve dispensed at the point of sale through a machine. TCBY became the largest frozen yogurt franchise in the world at that time. As others saw the success of TCBY, frozen yogurt took off in the 1980s, reaching sales of $25 million in 1986. Brands such as Colombo, Nanci's, and Miss Karen's came to prominence around that time in the United States and frozen yogurt was 10% of the frozen dessert market accounting for over $300 million in sales by the mid 1990s.[6] Demand for frozen yogurt slowed considerably in the late 1990s as Americans turned their attention to high-protein, high-fat diets. Low-fat foods such as frozen yogurt fell out of favor as food trends favored higher fat and lower cost ice cream at the turn of the millennium..</p>
					
					<h1>Raw Materials</h1>
					<p>Frozen yogurt gets its unique flavor from strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilous. The yogurt culture includes all the strains of bacteria in the product and makes up about 1% of the ingredients.

Frozen yogurt is made in much the same way as ice cream and, with the exception of yogurt culture, they are made from similar ingredients. Two of the most important elements in frozen yogurt are water and air. Air is incorporated into the mixture to add volume. Water exists in the liquid elements of the mix and is considered the continuous phase, which goes from liquid to a partially solid state. Frozen yogurt is never completely frozen; it simply contains ice crystals.

The primary ingredient in frozen yogurt is milk and milk products. Milkfat generally makes up between 0.5-6% of the ingredients depending on whether the frozen yogurt is non-fat, low-fat, or regular. Milkfat lends richness to the yogurt and is the synergist for other flavorings.</p>
						
						
					<h1>The Manufacturing Process</h1>
					<p>1 The ingredients are selected for freshness and quality. They are measured in precise quantities according to the particular recipe. Liquid and dry ingredients are combined separately.
2 The liquids are poured into a vat, mixed together, and heated. Next, the dry ingredients are added to the liquids in a particular order. Meanwhile the batch is stiffed and the temperature gradually increased. Most ingredients must be incorporated before the mix is heated to 120°F (49°C) so that the mix does not become lumpy. The mixture must be heated to dissolve and blend the ingredients.</p>
